Developer's Thoughts: 
Loved this project. I strayed from the original design provided when I saw a background image that caught my eye. Bootstrap made it quick to create the 1 required webpage, but I decided to add a couple extra pages since I had the time. The home page is a fun star wars style landing page with a background image and an active button that takes you to a form that can be filled out. There are 2 links at the bottom of the page that work, Objectives and Contact. The objectives page was built using a css library I found online and is *very* fun. Contact link is the same as the button and takes you to the form you can fill out (but no logic/server to submit). 

Overall, I thought bootstrap made it quite simple to create a responsive webpage. I still used some custom properties using sass and had 1 media query to adjust the font-sizes on smaller screens to avoid horizontal scrolling.
